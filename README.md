This is a project oriented around TCP/IP server and client communications

Run the binaries (located in the bin server), and give the server a port number
  (2000 - 65535). Give the client the name of the network (the name of your
  computer) as well as the port number you gave to the server.

This will establish a connection to the server and the client will be prompted
  to send the server a message. The server will respond to the client "World!"
  regardless of what the user says.

TODO:
  - Create the same server/client application in c++.
